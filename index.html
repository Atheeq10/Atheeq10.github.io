<h2>My story</h2>
<p>As the saying goes, “With great power comes great responsibility.” As the eldest of five children, I understand the challenges of being a role model from a young age. Learning to persevere through difficult situations has shaped my mindset and driven me to turn obstacles into stepping stones for growth. My journey is not just about personal progress, but about inspiring others who grow up with many siblings to recognise that challenges often come with hidden blessings. </p>
